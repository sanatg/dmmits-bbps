# ISRO - Journey to the Stars

Welcome to the "ISRO - Journey to the Stars" project, an interactive and immersive exploration of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and its many contributions to space exploration.

## Overview

This project reimagines the traditional exploration of a website by simulating a terminal environment, creating an engaging and interactive user experience. From the moment you land on the home page, you're greeted with a canvas of twinkling stars and the captivating soundtrack of "Interstellar". 

The site provides live information about vessels and missions via an API, allowing users to access and interact with the most recent and accurate data directly. 

## Usage

Due to the nature of live data fetching via API, it's recommended to run this website on a webserver for optimal performance and functionality. 

## Assets

The assets used in this project include:

- The theme song "Interstellar" to create an immersive auditory experience.
- A Terminal SVG from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/315644/terminal) for aesthetic enhancement.
